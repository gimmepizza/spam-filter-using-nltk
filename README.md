# spam-filter-using-nltk
This spam filter uses naive bayes classifier to train on 90% of the complete (all 5 ) enron databases.
I get an accuracy of 97.33 % on the test data (10% of dataset)
The code is in the intro.py file.
the pickle has the stored classifier.
but you need to proccess the test file too.....
